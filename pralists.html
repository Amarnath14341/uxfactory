        </b>
        <dd>Apple's reputation and brand allow it to charge a premium for its high-end products like the iPhone 11 Pro
            Max. And adding memory or storage to these products increases the cost even more. Because of this "Apple
            Tax" Apple products are often more expensive than its competitors</dd>

            <dt>BANANA:</dt>
        </b>
        <dd>Bananas contain fiber, potassium, folate, and antioxidants, such as vitamin C. All of these support heart
            health. A 2017 review found that people who follow a high fiber diet have a lower risk of cardiovascular
            disease than those on a low fiber diet.</dd>

            <dt>ORANGE:</dt>
        </b>
        <dd>The colour orange takes its name from the fruit. The word "orange" is unusual because it is one of only a
            few English words that do not rhyme with anything.</dd>
