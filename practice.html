            With an agreed-upon design, we proceed to develop your site. By using a Content Management System (CMS),
            select themes and plugins, and our own toolkits, we accelerate development to deliver faster time to value
            and lower overall costs without sacrificing quality. We offer flexible options that allow you to save
            further by entering your own content or have us enter your content when funding is easier to find then time.
            We build the prototype then we review and refine together in an iterative, agile development process.

            Trail Websites bases most of the sites we develop on WordPress. WordPress is a well known CMS with many
            available themes and plugins to save development time and cost. Our own Trail Data Managerâ„¢ toolkit is
            designed to work with WordPress to display overview grids, detailed trail pages and a downloadable PDF trail
            guide from our trails database. While WordPress is our go-to tool, our experts also have experience with
            Drupal and Joomla, among other CMSes, and Trail Data Managerâ„¢ will be integrated with Drupal after its
            initial release if there is sufficient customer demand.
