        <p>A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical
            space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". In this article, we'll examine HTML
            block-level elements and how they differ from inline-level elements.</p>
    </div>
    <span style="background-color: darkturquoise;">INLINE ELEMENTS</span>
    <p>
        Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is
        an example of an inline element. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.
